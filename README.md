# 🌟 Canaima

This is the repository for my [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) and [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) files.
This is mainly divided in host configuration and home configuration

**Home Configuration:** Handles User-lever applications, dotfiles and theming.

## 🖥️ Host configurations

Handles OS-level operations (Bootloader, Kernel, Hardware, Window Managers)

### ⛰️ Canaima

Canaima is meant to be the configuration that i use in my personal laptop with NixOS, it was working before with `hyprland`, but my old laptop is too slow for it, so now i'm using `sway`

### 🥑 Suckless

I wanted a config that does not take much from my old laptop so i started to use this, as window manager there is `dwm` as menu `dmenu` of course and as terminal there is `st`
So far it's ok but it needs more work.
All of this is being handled as os level (`NixOS`) because the idea of using suckless software is for old laptops like my old one
