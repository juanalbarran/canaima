# Browsers

The browser module, here is the config for the main browser applications that i'm gonna use

## Qutebrowser

More like a vim browser, still testing it but it looks good
The Qutebrowser has the config to avoid ads on youtube, that's the "m" keybind and <Ctrl-m>. This will open the mpv media player and reproduce the youtube video.

## Firefox

Nice, but i think i prefer Qutebrowser

## Brave

Only for applications webpages like Gemini or others
